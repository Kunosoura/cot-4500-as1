UCF numerical calculus chapter 1 and 2 assignment

This uses only built-in python modules, so requirements.txt is blank

I installed Python 3.11.1 using the installer given on the Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/

I was able to execute the script on Windows by running the following command from the project directory
within the command prompt.

python.exe src\main\assignment_1.py

Output was verified to match the expected output

o.txt is the assignment solutions provided
out.txt is the output of the program
